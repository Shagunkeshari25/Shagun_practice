# 1. What is the output of the following function when head node of following linked list is passed as input?
#     1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 

# 2. WAP to find the maximum value in a linked list and replace it with given value.
#    (assume that the LL is populated with whole numbers and there is only one max. value in the LL)

# 3. Given a LL containing whole numbers,Write a funtion which finds and return the sum of all elements 
#    at the odd position in the given LL.

# 4. WAP to reverse a LL containing integer data (in-place reversal)

# 5. Given a LL of characters. Write a python function to return a new string that is created by appending all the

#    replace '*' or '/' by a single space and in case two concecutive occurences of those then replace by a single space
#    and convert next character to uppar case
